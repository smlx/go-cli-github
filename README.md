This repository is a template for a Go CLI tool or service.
It is quite opinionated about security and release engineering, but hopefully in a good way.

It comes pre-configured for integration with GitHub-specific features such as [Dependabot security tooling](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot), [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/), and [branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches).
It also automatically builds and tests your code using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Features

* Use [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to automatically build and create GitHub Releases and Docker images on merge to `main`.

    * This uses the [Conventional Commits Versioner](https://github.com/smlx/ccv) to automatically version each release.

* Lint your commit messages, and your Go, GitHub Action, and Dockerfile code.
* Test Pull Requests using `go test`.
* Build Docker images from Pull Requests for manual testing and review.
* Static code analysis using [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) and [Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/).
* Test coverage analysis using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).
* Security analysis using [OpenSSF](https://securityscorecards.dev).

## How to use

First set up the GitHub repo

1. Create a new empty GitHub repository.

Then push some code to main:

1. Install [gonew](https://go.dev/blog/gonew) and run this command, replacing the last argument with the name of your new module:

    ```bash
    gonew github.com/smlx/go-cli-github@main github.com/smlx/newproject
    ```

1. Create the git repo and push to `main` (which will become the default branch):

    ```bash
    cd newproject
    git init .
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin git@github.com:smlx/newproject.git
    git add .
    git commit -am 'chore: create repository from template'
    git push -u origin main
    ```

1. Create the `badges` branch for storing the README coverage badge.

    ```bash
    git checkout --orphan badges
    git rm -rf .
    rm -f .gitignore
    echo 'This branch exists only to store the coverage badge in the README on `main`.' > README.md
    git add README.md
    git commit -m 'chore: initialize the badges branch'
    git push origin badges
    ```

Then customize the code for your repository:

1. Check out a new branch to set up the repo `git checkout -b setup main`

1. Update the code for your project:

    * rename `cmd/go-cli-github` to `cmd/$YOUR_COMMAND`
    * rename `deploy/go-cli-github` to `deploy/$YOUR_COMMAND`
    * update `deploy/$YOUR_COMMAND/Dockerfile`
    * update `.github/workflows/build.yaml`, replacing `go-cli-github` with `$YOUR_COMMAND`.
    * update `.goreleaser.yaml` to build `cmd/$YOUR_COMMAND`
    * update the links at the top of `README.md`
    * update the contact email in `SECURITY.md`

1. Commit and push:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -am 'chore: update template for new project'
    git push -u origin setup
    ```
1. Open a PR, wait until all the checks go green, then merge the PR.

Configure the repository:

1. Go to repository Settings > General:

    * Disable wiki and projects (unless you plan to use them!)
    * Allow only merge commits for Pull Requests
    * Allow auto-merge
    * Automatically delete head branches

1. Go to repository Settings > Code security and analysis, and enable:

    * Private vulnerability reporting

1. Go to repository Settings > Rules > Rulesets, and import the `protect-default-branch.json` ruleset.

That's it.

## How to contribute

Issues are welcome.

PRs are also welcome, but keep in mind that this is a very opinionated template, so not all changes will be accepted.
PRs also need to ensure that test coverage remains high, and best practices are followed.
